<h2>How It All Began</h2>
<div class="cronleydiv">
<p class="cronley">The Pleasure Island Chamber of Commerce was formed in 1937 with Robert Cronly Plummer serving as the first President. Robert was the son of Carolina Beach's very first Mayor, John W. Plummer. The Chamber, then called the Carolina Beach Chamber of Commerce, was formed as a non-profit, membership-based organization with a focus on the business community of the island.</p>

<p class="beach">The Carolina Beach Chamber of Commerce often held meetings in various businesses around town. On May 17, 1939, the board held the first meeting of the year at the Palais Royal Hotel, what is now the Carolina Beach Boardwalk area. At the time, it was the largest and most enthusiastic meeting the Chamber had to date with the new officers and Robert Conly Plummer leading the way.</p>
<p class="moniker">During the 1970's, the moniker "Pleasure Island" was adopted by the Chamber of Commerce and inspired by realtors who wanted to include the 5 beaches; Fort Fisher, Kure Beach, Hanby Beach, Wilmington Beach and Carolina Beach. Thus, the Pleasure Island Chamber of Commerce was formed. This made it easier for the local realtors to sell property in the area and less confusing for the potential buyers.</p>
